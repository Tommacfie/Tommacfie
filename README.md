I am a Front End Software Developer with professional experience building applications using ReactJS, TypeScript, and GraphQL. My professional experience also includes thorough application testing with frameworks like Playwright, Cypress, and Jest.

I am dedicated to crafting applications through a methodical and structured approach, ensuring coherent, logical, and well-organized code. My attention to detail is crucial for producing clean, durable code that minimizes debugging and technical debt. I excel in clear communication and enjoy collaborating with a well-organized, focused, and determined team.

Outside of development, I am passionate about music and music composition. I sing, play guitar and piano, and have performed regularly as a resident artist at the Cavern Club in Liverpool. Additionally, I enjoy bouldering and cycling.
