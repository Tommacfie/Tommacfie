I am a Full-stack Software Developer experienced in Javascript technologies such as React, Typescript, GraphQl, Express and NodeJs, as well as DBRMS's including MongoDb and PostgreSQL.

I'm passionate about building applications using a methodical, structured approach in order to deliver coherent, logical and well-organised code. I have a keen eye for detail, which is essential for producing clean, durable code that requires less debugging. I thrive on clear communication and value working in a well-organised, focused and determined team.

My passions include Music and Music Composition. I sing and play guitar and piano, and used to perform twice a week at the Cavern Club in Liverpool as a resident artist. Other hobbies include Bouldering and Cycling.
